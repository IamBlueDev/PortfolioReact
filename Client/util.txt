  *  Minimalist Portfolio 
  * basic server API to help for future improvements.
  * Quick overview on Work and Education experience

I achieved the first goal by using my previous designs for portfolios that were made in other frameworks and gaining inspiration from them. I ended up with a card like setup where everything is in front of the user and they can explore the website simply using the scroll wheel

The second goal i had set myself was the hardest to achieve as this is where I had to do the most research, I wanted to have an easy to setup API that would allow me to access and receive data in the form of models. The reason I wanted a model format for the data as this is the easiest way to insure the code doesn't break in the future updates.

And finally the last goal was to allow the user to glance over my experience quickly, I achieved this by having my work experience and education experience in a section together, one on the left and the other on the right. 

Overall I am very satisfied with this project as it allowed me to learn a lot about how react works and improved my backend skills also.
